# Batch annotation — manual QA log

Random-sampled instances annotated with the finalized pipeline (3 samples +
aggregate). Each is QA'd by hand as it lands: a brief note if fine, a detailed
one if something is wrong. Outputs live under `outputs/related_files/swebench_pro/<id>/`
(committed as the deliverable). Sampling seed: `20260706`
(`round{1,2,3}_ids.txt`).

Legend: ✅ good · ⚠️ minor · ❌ problem.

### Round 1 summary

20/20 valid & complete; **19 ✅ / 1 ⚠️ / 0 ❌**. Cost $34.62 (80 agent calls).

- The annotator reliably covers the **existing** gold-patch code files + relevant
  tests, and correctly excludes: files the patch *creates* (new files), docs
  (changelog / porting-guide / `.asciidoc`), and dependency manifests
  (`go.mod` / `go.sum` / `go.work.sum`). Candidates were very consistent.
- The one genuine gap (**#11**): two **existing** UI template files (`*.html`)
  the fix modifies were omitted, while core logic + tests were covered.
- **No severe problems.** Refinement for round 2: a prompt line to ensure every
  *existing* file the gold patch modifies is covered (not files it creates).

## Round 2

_Tuned prompt (coverage line). Lighter QA: valid + gold-code coverage per example._

### Round 2 summary

20/20 valid & complete; **19 ✅ / 1 ⚠️ / 0 ❌** (both no-output failures recovered
after the robustness fix). The tuned prompt (existing-file coverage line) held up.

- **Coverage.** Every *existing* gold-patch code file is covered except one
  (below). A whole-repo self-check of all aggregates on disk found the only
  "missed" files to be legitimately-excluded non-code: docs (`.rst`
  porting-guide, `.asciidoc` changelogs), dependency lockfiles (`go.mod` /
  `go.sum` / `go.work.sum`), and **generated** protobuf (`*.pb.go`). None are
  readable source a solver would open.
- **The one genuine gap (#6):** `openlibrary/catalog/marc/parse_xml.py` (a MARC
  parser the fix touches) was omitted by all three candidates despite the
  coverage line — a single-file miss on one instance, core logic + tests still
  covered. Minor, not severe.
- **Robustness validated in the field.** Two samples (#13, #15) hit the flaky
  MissingOutputError; the fix (`df22a2f` — retry no-output samples + aggregate
  the survivors) recovered both on re-run, with no pipeline deaths afterward.
- **No severe problems.** Proceeding to round 3 (41–60) with the same setup.

## Round 3

_Same setup (tuned prompt, 3+aggregate, rolling window of 4). Examples 41–60,
`round3_ids.txt`, disjoint from rounds 1–2._

### Round 3 summary

20/20 valid & complete; **20 ✅ / 0 ⚠️ / 0 ❌**. No pipeline deaths (robustness
fix held). The tuned prompt continues to cover existing gold code + tests and
exclude new files, docs, lockfiles, and generated code.

- **Two noisy bundled gold patches surfaced (a dataset property, not an agent
  bug).** #5 (NodeBB plugin-identifier validation) ships a gold patch of **106
  files** — 99 are i18n `public/language/*.json`, and 5 belong to an unrelated
  "reputation settings" feature squashed into the same commit; the annotation
  correctly targeted the real fix (`src/plugins/install.js` + error message +
  test). #7 (flipt config metadata) bundles CI/release infra (workflows,
  `.goreleaser`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, docs, `go.mod/go.sum`); the
  annotation covered the two config source files and excluded the infra. In both
  cases the annotation is **better-scoped than the raw gold patch**.
- **Whole-corpus self-check (all 61 aggregates on disk): 0 invalid.** Only two
  instances "miss" a source-looking gold file: #5 above (the unrelated bundled
  feature) and round-2 #6 (`parse_xml.py`, the single genuine minor miss). Every
  other apparent miss is a doc, lockfile, generated file, or new file.
- **No severe problems across 60 sampled instances (rounds 1–3).**

### Round 4 summary

20/20 valid & complete; **20 ✅ / 0 ⚠️ / 0 ❌**. Whole-corpus self-check (all 81
aggregates on disk): 0 invalid; the only source-file misses remain the two known
cases (round-3 #5 bundled reputation feature, round-2 #6 `parse_xml.py`). Round 4
introduced no new gaps.

- **One transient failure, caught and fixed (#5, navidrome).** The aggregate
  step exited nonzero and the run died even though all 3 samples had succeeded.
  Investigation (`.cache/annotate-failures/…__agg.log`) showed the real cause was
  an **API 401 "Invalid authentication credentials"** written to *stdout* — a
  mid-session OAuth-token blip after 18 turns / ~13.5 min of successful work; an
  immediate re-aggregate from the saved candidates succeeded. Two code fixes
  landed (`f78594c`, `3044d87`): parse stdout on failure so API errors are
  classified from `result`/`api_error_status` instead of empty stderr, and treat
  a mid-session 401 as retryable. Recovered via re-aggregation → ✅ 10/10.
- **No severe problems.**

### Round 5 summary

20/20 valid & complete; **20 ✅ / 0 ⚠️ / 0 ❌**. Ran with the CLI-failure
classification fix live — no failures this round. Whole-corpus self-check (all
101 aggregates on disk): 0 invalid; the only source-file misses remain the two
known cases (round-3 #5 bundled feature, round-2 #6 `parse_xml.py`).

- One borderline (#10, navidrome): the only uncovered existing file was
  `reflex.conf`, a dev hot-reload tooling config — not application source a
  solver would read. Counted ✅.
- **No severe problems.**

### Final tally (100 sampled — phase 1 complete)

| round | valid | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 20/20 | 19 | 1 | 0 | ⚠️ = #11 two existing UI templates missed |
| 2 | 20/20 | 19 | 1 | 0 | ⚠️ = #6 parse_xml.py; 2 flaky no-output samples recovered |
| 3 | 20/20 | 20 | 0 | 0 | 2 noisy bundled gold patches correctly scoped |
| 4 | 20/20 | 20 | 0 | 0 | 1 transient 401 caught → classifier fix; recovered |
| 5 | 20/20 | 20 | 0 | 0 | clean; ran with the fix live |
| **all** | **100/100** | **98** | **2** | **0** | 0 severe; 0 invalid across 101 aggregates on disk |

**Takeaways for the full-dataset run.** The pipeline is stable: 100/100 valid, no
severe errors, and the two failure modes we hit (flaky no-output samples; a
mid-session API 401) are now retried instead of killing a run. The two ⚠️ misses
are single existing-file omissions on otherwise-correct annotations. The metric
to watch is *existing gold-code coverage*, not raw file overlap — a large share
of gold-patch files are new files, docs, lockfiles, generated code, or (in a few
cases) unrelated changes bundled into the same commit, all correctly excluded.

## Round 6 (stream capture) — 2026-07-09

Purpose: validate the new `--capture stream` implementation (no reverse proxy;
trace derived from `claude --output-format stream-json`). 20 new instances,
pairwise-disjoint from rounds 1–5 (`round6_ids.txt`, seed `20260709`), each run
through the full 3-samples + aggregate pipeline in stream mode.

- **20/20 valid, 20/20 complete, all `capture=stream`.** The stream
  completeness signal (terminal `result.subtype == "success"`) and the unified
  exchange record work correctly end to end.
- **Existing-gold coverage: 17/20 full; 3 minor misses**, all in the
  correctly-excluded category (not code a solver must read):
  - ansible `…/developing_modules_documenting.rst` (doc)
  - element-web `src/i18n/strings/en_EN.json` (i18n strings)
  - vuls `README.md`, `go.mod`, `go.sum` (doc + dep manifests)
- **No severe problems; 0 invalid.** Quality matches the proxy-mode phase-1
  rounds — same doc/manifest omission pattern, no regression from stream.
- **One operational hiccup, not a stream bug:** `protonmail/webclients-2c3559`
  failed provisioning on a *stale git worktree* still pointing at the pre-rename
  repo path. Root-caused and fixed in `core/repo/provider.py` (self-heal: rebuild
  a broken worktree, `prune` + `--force` on add); re-ran cleanly (4/4 gold).

| round | valid | ✅ full | ⚠ minor | ❌ | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 (stream) | 20/20 | 17 | 3 | 0 | doc/manifest/i18n omissions only; stream == proxy quality |

**Verdict:** stream capture is validated — safe to use, and a reasonable
candidate to make the default. Proxy remains the code default for now.

## Round 7 (stream) — 2026-07-10

20/20 valid, all 3-candidate, **0 STALL, 0 severe**. Coverage 15 full / 5 minor
(en_EN.json i18n, go.mod/manifest, docs — all correctly-excluded).

Operational: the initial run hit a **memory-thrashing hang** (9 concurrent agents
+ old `capture_output` buffering big-repo streams in RAM → swap → processes
frozen 40-150 min/instance, 13h for 14). Fixed (`c4d12d5`): stream stdout to
file + `killpg` the process group on timeout. 4 instances came out 2-candidate (a
sample died on `"API Error: socket connection closed unexpectedly"`); re-ran them
+ the unfinished ones at MAXJOBS=2 → all 3-candidate, perf clean (wall≈active).
Added `perf_check.py` (per-run stall detection) — run it alongside `qa_check.py`
every round now.

## Round 8 (stream) — 2026-07-10

20/20 valid, all 3-candidate, **1 STALL, 0 severe**. Coverage 19 full / 1 minor
(one ansible task missed 4 `.rst`/`.txt` docs — correctly-excluded doc files).

Ran at **MAXJOBS=2** end-to-end. First tried **MAXJOBS=4** (12 agents): even with
the round-7 file-stream fix it swap-thrashed (6/20 in 36 min, pipelines stuck
27-32 min, swapout +~1.6 GB), so fell back to 2. At 2 the box stayed healthy
all round (≈45-57% free, swapout flat) — the memory hang is a
concurrency-vs-16 GB problem, mode-independent. The **1 STALL** (`ansible-b2a289`,
candidate_1 wall 589s / active 195s → idle 394s) was **not** memory: it's an
occasional Claude Code API-retry backoff (transient socket drop), well under the
1800s timeout — the agent recovered and the final stayed 3-candidate. Combined
parquet now 161 instances / 1488 snippets; 644 traces (95.5 MB) pushed.

| 8 (stream) | 20/20 | 20/20 | 19 | 1 | 1 | MAXJOBS=2 (4 thrashes); 1 API-retry stall, recovered |

## Round 9 (stream) — 2026-07-10

20/20 valid, all 3-candidate, **0 STALL**. Coverage 16 full / 4 minor. Ran at
MAXJOBS=2, healthy throughout (≈47-48% free, swapout flat, 0 failures).

3 of the 4 minor misses are the usual correctly-excluded doc/manifest files
(`.asciidoc`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `go.mod/go.sum`, an `examples/*/main.go`). The
**one substantive gap**: `vuls-4a72295d` (Trivy library-only scan) covered the
core fix files (parser/detector/base.go) + the adjacent `models/library.go` but
missed two other modified model files, `models/cvecontents.go` /
`models/vulninfos.go` — a real annotation-recall miss, not a pipeline defect
(valid, 3-candidate, no stall). Left as-is pending review; re-run wouldn't
reliably improve recall. Combined parquet now 181 instances / 1678 snippets.

## Round 10 (stream) — 2026-07-10

20/20 valid, all 3-candidate, **0 STALL**. Coverage 16 full / 4 minor — every
miss is a correctly-excluded manifest/doc/generated file (`go.mod/sum/work.sum`,
`README.md`, `rpc/flipt_grpc.pb.go`). Ran at MAXJOBS=2, healthy throughout
(swapout +~63 MB over the round, no thrash). No source-recall misses in this
round.

## Recall audit across all 201 — source-file misses

Added `recall_audit.py`: for every annotated instance it classifies each missed
existing-gold file as *acceptable* (doc / i18n / dependency-manifest / generated
code / build-CI / test-data) vs *source* (real app code). Manually reviewed all
32 instances that had any miss — the classifier had **no false negatives** (no
real source hidden in the "acceptable" bucket); its only errors are
over-inclusion, caught by hand:

- **`vuls-4a72295`** — genuine miss (`cvecontents.go`, `vulninfos.go`). Re-ran:
  best of 3 attempts reached 4/7, recovering `cvecontents.go` + `scanner/base.go`;
  `vulninfos.go` missed in all 3 runs = a real recall ceiling (likely a
  peripheral model tweak). **Kept the 4/7 aggregate.**
- **`openlibrary-b67138`** — genuine miss (`catalog/marc/parse_xml.py`, the MARC
  parser central to the 880-field task). Re-ran → **6/6, fixed.**
- **`NodeBB-76c6e30`** — *not* a defect. Problem is plugin-id validation; the
  annotation correctly found `src/plugins/install.js` + `cli/manage.js` +
  `constants.js` + `test/plugins.js`. The "missed source" (`flags.js`,
  `topic.js`, `reputation.tpl`) belongs to an unrelated reputation feature
  bundled in the same gold commit — correctly excluded. Left as-is.
- **`flipt-3d5a345`** (`examples/openfeature/main.go`) and **`navidrome-ee21f3`**
  (`reflex.conf`) — peripheral example / dev-tooling files, not needed to solve
  the stated problem. Left as-is.

Lesson: a low coverage ratio can be gold-patch contamination (bundled unrelated
files), not an annotation failure — so a "source miss" must be confirmed against
the problem statement, not trusted from the metric alone. Combined parquet: 201
instances / 1874 snippets.

## Round 11 (stream) — 2026-07-12

20/20 valid, all 3-candidate, **0 STALL**. MAXJOBS=2, healthy (swapout flat, 0
failures). Coverage 16 full / 4 minor; misses are doc/i18n/manifest/build except
one genuine source gap: `teleport-0415e422` missed
`lib/utils/prompt/confirmation.go` (multi-device U2F prompt util) — annotation
otherwise nailed 8/9 incl. an extra relevant file; re-ran once, converged on the
identical 8 files, so confirmation.go is a recall ceiling like vuls' vulninfos.go.
Kept. Also tightened `recall_audit.py` (Taskfile.yml → build infra) after it
false-flagged `flipt-9f8127f`. Combined parquet: 221 instances / 2105 snippets.

## Round 12 (stream) — 2026-07-12

20/20 valid, all 3-candidate, **0 STALL**. MAXJOBS=2, healthy. Coverage 16 full /
4 minor — every miss is a correctly-excluded doc/manifest file
(`changelog.asciidoc`, `go.mod/sum`, `.rst`, `go.work.sum`). **No source-recall
misses** (recall_audit clean for this round). Combined parquet: 241 instances /
2314 snippets.

## Round 14 (stream) — 2026-07-12 (spanned a credit-limit interruption)

20/20 valid, all 3-candidate, **0 STALL**. MAXJOBS=2. The overnight run hit the
Claude **credit limit** ~05:14 (committed 11/20 = 272 as `1f7962a`); resumed
after reset and finished the remaining 9. Coverage 13 full / 7 minor — all misses
correctly-excluded manifest/i18n/doc (`go.mod/sum/work.sum`, `.gitignore`,
`en_EN.json`, `.asciidoc`). One auditor hit (`webclients-caf10ba9`,
`calendar/support.ts`) is **not** a real gap: an 84-file *restructuring* task
where the annotation nailed 81/82 and support.ts is a pure move (+0/-0 lines).
Kept. Combined parquet: 281 instances / 2782 snippets.

are `go.mod/sum` and a `.svg` image asset (`webclients-2dce79ea`, 15/16). The
svg was an auditor false-positive → tightened `recall_audit.py` to treat image
assets (`.svg/.png/.jpg/...`) as non-source. **No real source-recall misses.**

0 failures). Coverage 13 full / 7 minor. Two auditor hits, both judged non-defects
by reading the patch: `tutanota-befce4b` `ViewSlider.ts` is a +1/-1 ripple
unrelated to the SendMailModel-test problem; `flipt-af7a0be` `config/default.yml`
is a +2/-1 config-data file (annotation got 8/10 incl. the core tracing code).
Both skipped. Combined parquet: 381 instances / 3795 snippets.

API-retry backoff, not memory; both recovered, finals stayed 3-candidate. These
API stalls ticked up around the credit-limit-recovery window. Combined parquet:

## Rounds 21-25 (stream) — 2026-07-14 — reaches 501 total

**100/100 valid, all 3-candidate, 0 STALL** across all five rounds. Coverage 90
full / 10 minor. Ran overnight at MAXJOBS=2 (~4h17m for the 92 that completed);
**hit the credit limit in the tail (rounds 24-25)** — 8 instances failed
all-samples on the session wall (navidrome ×2, openlibrary ×2, teleport ×2, vuls
×2), committed nothing mid-batch, retried after the 8:20am reset → **all 8
resolved, 3-candidate**.

`recall_audit` over the full 501 flags 1 apparent source miss in this batch:
`openlibrary-2fe532a` misses `scripts/affiliate_server.py`. **Re-run + verified
NON-DEFECT:** that gold hunk is a +2/-2 edit *inside a module docstring's example
block* (`params`→`args`, adds `proxy_url=` to the illustrative snippet), not the
language-field logic — which lives in `openlibrary/core/vendors.py` (`AmazonAPI`),
and the annotation *does* cover it. A fresh 3-sample re-run (cand [8,7,7])
consistently and correctly excludes the docstring example, so it's a recall
ceiling of the non-defect kind (like vuls-4a72295 before it), not a real gap.
Restored the original annotation (re-run was equivalent). One borderline
auditor hit, `qutebrowser-233cb1cc` `pytest.ini`, is a test-config file (alongside
two `doc/*.asciidoc`), not app source — skipped. All other minor misses are
correctly-excluded docs / manifests / NOTICE (`.rst`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
`go.mod`/`go.sum`, `vendor/modules.txt`, `doc/*.asciidoc`, `HACKING.md`). Combined
parquet: **501 instances / 4926 snippets**.

## Round 26 (stream) — 2026-07-14 — reaches 521 total

`openlibrary/i18n/messages.pot` (i18n), `doc/changelog.asciidoc` (changelog doc),
`docs/docsite/rst/dev_guide/developing_modules_best_practices.rst` (docs). No new

the same 10 known instances from prior rounds — none from round 26. New auditor
hit: `tutao__tutanota-befce4b` misses `src/gui/base/ViewSlider.ts` (round 19) —
**verified NON-DEFECT**: that patch hunk is a pure import-line reorder (moves
`import type {windowSizeListener}` from line 13 to line 3, +1/-1 cosmetic only),

(also missed `Makefile` from qa_check). **Verified NON-DEFECT:** `.drone.yml` is
a CI pipeline config (renamed a test step); `Makefile` is build infra (added
chaos test target); `ping.proto` is an **empty file** (`e69de29bb2d1d` = git's
