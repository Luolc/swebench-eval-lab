"""Sample-and-aggregate: reconcile N candidate annotations into one.

Given several independent annotations of the same instance, an aggregator agent
reads the candidates + the task context + the real checkout and synthesizes a
single best annotation. This is the reliability path for the ambiguous cases a
single run varies on (test-coverage extent, whole-vs-focus on borderline files).

Like the annotator, this is a thin wrapper over :func:`agent_run.run_agent`,
differing only in the prompt and the extra ``candidates.json`` context file.

  return f"""\
You are aggregating {n_candidates} independent candidate annotations of the same
SWE-bench task into a single, best annotation. Each candidate is one attempt at
listing the code a solver must READ to fix the task; they may disagree.

Your working directory is a read-only checkout of `{repo}` at the base commit
(no environment configured — do not build, run, or modify anything). Task
context is in `{CONTEXT_DIR}/` (problem_statement, requirements, interface,
gold_patch.diff, test_patch.diff, git_log). The {n_candidates} candidates are in
`{CONTEXT_DIR}/{CANDIDATES_FILE}` — a list, each with a `snippets` array.

Decide what belongs by judgment, not by vote: for each candidate region ask
whether a solver truly needs to READ it to solve THIS task, using the problem
statement and gold patch as the ground truth. You MAY keep a good region only
one candidate found, and you MAY drop a region the majority included.

Reconcile into the single best set of snippets, each verified against the ACTUAL
repo files:
  - Files: include exactly the files a solver must read. Drop peripheral picks
    (localization / generated / schema) unless clearly needed.
  - Ranges: choose the MOST APPROPRIATE contiguous range for each relevant unit
    — usually the whole function / method / class / block, but keep a little
    surrounding context when it genuinely aids understanding, and trim when
    candidates over-reach. It need not be the tightest possible; aim for a range
    a careful reviewer would agree with and reproduce.
  - File scope: include the parts of each file a solver must read for THIS task.
    Take a file whole only when the whole file is genuinely relevant; when only
    part of it is relevant, select the relevant unit(s) rather than the whole
    file.
  - Tests: include the complete test case(s) that define the expected behavior,
    but not the entire test file unless it is all relevant.
  - No trivial single-line import snippets.

Write the result to `{ANNOTATION_OUTPUT}` — an object with a `snippets` array;
each snippet has `file_path`, `start_line`, `end_line`, `category`
(referenced-function | context-file | useful-unit-test | interface-contract |
similar-pattern), and a one-sentence `description`. Then run

    python3 {VALIDATOR_SCRIPT}

and fix until it prints `OK`. Finish only then — the output file is your only
deliverable."""
