"""Failure taxonomy and classification for annotation / aggregation runs.

We do not yet know every way a headless Claude Code run can fail, so the policy
is deliberately conservative:

- **Retry only clearly-transient failures** (network blips, rate limits,
  overload, timeouts).
- **Never retry a usage/quota exhaustion** — it will keep failing until the
  subscription window refreshes, so the batch should stop and wait instead.
- **Preserve raw diagnostics** for every failure, so unknown error shapes can be
  understood and this classifier refined.

Classification is keyword-based over whatever text we can get (stderr, the CLI
result message, the API error status). The keyword lists are best guesses and
are meant to be tightened as real failures are observed.
