"""The backend seam: one way to realize a live sandbox.

Two implementations are planned. A **host-orchestrated Docker backend**: the
host drives ``docker create/start/exec/rm`` and the workspace directory is
bind-mounted into the container. A **GitHub-Actions container-job backend**:
the CI job itself runs inside the instance's image, so the workspace is just
a local directory and ``exec`` runs in the job's own shell.

The manager and observers are backend-agnostic. Because the workspace lands
at a different in-sandbox path per backend (a fixed mount point vs. an
arbitrary runner directory), generated scripts never hardcode it — they
reference workspace files only through the ``SANDBOX_WORKSPACE`` environment
variable, which every backend sets on each exec. That is the whole contract
that lets one script text run unchanged on any backend (the same pattern as
GitHub Actions' own ``GITHUB_WORKSPACE``).
