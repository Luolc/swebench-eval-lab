"""Patch helpers shared by ``rollout`` (extract) and ``evaluation`` (apply).

Producing a git diff that re-applies cleanly with ``git apply`` is deceptively
error-prone; this module is the small, testable core of it. See ADR-0001
(``docs/decisions``) for the full rationale and the alternatives rejected.

- :func:`build_extraction_script` — the in-container bash that turns an agent's
  edits into a canonical, applyable **text** diff vs ``base_ref``. It stages new
  files with ``git add -N`` (intent-to-add) and diffs **without** ``--binary``,
  so binary content is never serialized — the happy path is text-only. We pass
  the instance's ``base_commit`` as ``base_ref`` so the patch applies against
  the exact base the grader resets to.
- :func:`strip_binary_hunks` — drop binary ``diff --git`` sections from a patch.
  Omitting ``--binary`` (not ``git add -N`` — that part is incidental) is what
  keeps binary *bytes* out; a binary change then still shows as a bytes-free
  ``Binary files ... differ`` header, which would break ``git apply``. The
  rollout runner calls this on the extracted patch to remove those sections so
  the graded patch is cleanly text-only (matching what Scale's Pro harness
  strips before apply).
- :func:`is_effectively_empty` — an empty/no-op patch is a failed attempt, never
  a pass. True once a binary-only patch has its hunks stripped.
