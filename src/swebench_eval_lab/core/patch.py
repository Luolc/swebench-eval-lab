"""Patch helpers shared by ``rollout`` (extract) and ``evaluation`` (apply).

Producing a git diff that re-applies cleanly with ``git apply`` is deceptively
error-prone; the grounded corner-case survey is in
[`docs/patch-extraction.md`](../../../docs/patch-extraction.md). This module is
the small, testable core of that survey:

- :func:`build_extraction_script` — the in-container bash that turns an agent's
  edits into a canonical, applyable diff (survey §7). It relies on committing
  the post-setup repo state as ``base_ref`` (survey §2.10) so environment/build
  mutations never enter the patch — which is why it needs **no** fragile
  ``:(exclude)`` denylist by default.
- :func:`strip_binary_hunks` — drop binary ``diff --git`` sections from a patch,
  as Scale's Pro harness does before ``git apply`` (survey §1). Our grader does
  **not** call it — SBP's golden patches are binary-free and binary is kept out
  of agent patches upstream at extraction — kept as a standalone helper.
- :func:`is_effectively_empty` — an empty/no-op patch is a failed attempt, never
  a pass (survey §5.4).
