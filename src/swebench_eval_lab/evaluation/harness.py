"""Fetch the per-instance test harness (run_script + parser) from Scale's repo.

The authoritative ``run_script.sh`` (native test invocation) and ``parser.py``
(test output -> structured results) for each instance live in the
MIT-licensed ``scaleapi/SWE-bench_Pro-os`` repo under
``run_scripts/<instance_id>/``. Rather than vendoring ~1000 files into git or
carrying the whole harness as a submodule, we fetch just the two files we need
per instance, from a **pinned commit**, into a gitignored cache. Reproducible
(pinned), keeps the repo small, and clearly
attributes the source. Everything else eval needs (``fail_to_pass`` /
``pass_to_pass`` / ``before_repo_set_cmd`` / ``selected_test_files_to_run`` /
``dockerhub_tag``) is already a real column in our dataset.

# Why this SHA: it was the tip of origin/main when we built this — pinned
# 2026-07-10; the commit itself is dated 2026-05-18 ("Merge PR #98 from
# scaleapi/miguelrc-scale-patch-1"), i.e. the latest harness at the time. We pin
# a SHA instead of tracking main so the fetched run_script.sh / parser.py can't
# drift under us mid-project. Bump deliberately, and only after re-checking that
# the new scripts still match our eval logic.
