"""Run one rollout: a headless agent solves an instance inside its container.

Dataset-agnostic: takes an :class:`~swebench_eval_lab.core.benchmark.EvalSpec`
(which image, workdir, base_commit) plus a ready-made solve ``prompt``, and
returns the extracted patch + the agent's trajectory as a unified exchange
record. The dataset-specific prompt construction lives in the CLI (``__main__``)
so this runner never learns a dataset's fields.

Flow: provision the pinned agent binary → stage a workspace (prompt +
entryscript) → ``docker run`` the instance image with the binary bind-mounted
and the OAuth token inherited by reference → read back the raw extraction, strip
any residual binary marker section to a clean text patch, read the
``stream-json`` trajectory → guard the empty patch. The produced patch is a
text diff vs ``base_commit``, meant to be handed straight to ``evaluation``.
