"""Build the in-container rollout entryscript.

The script runs inside the instance's prebuilt image (the repo is checked out
at ``base_commit`` in ``workdir``). It: prepares a writable HOME, runs the
headless Claude Code agent on the repo (streaming its ``stream-json`` trajectory
to a mounted file), then extracts the agent's edits as a text-only,
``git apply``-able patch via the shared
:func:`~swebench_eval_lab.core.patch.build_extraction_script` (written to the
raw patch file; the runner strips any residual binary marker section host-side).

**Base for the diff (MVP choice).** We diff against the instance's original
``base_commit``, not a fresh post-setup commit. That guarantees the grading
round-trip — the grader does ``git reset --hard base_commit`` then
``git apply`` — and a patch relative to ``base_commit`` applies cleanly there
(the dataset's own gold patches are diffs vs ``base_commit`` and apply, so the
convention is proven). The post-setup-commit alternative is deferred (see
``PLAN.md`` → "Patch extraction — open decisions", D1).
