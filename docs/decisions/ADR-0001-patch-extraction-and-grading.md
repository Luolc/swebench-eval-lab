# ADR-0001: Patch extraction and grading

## Context

Workstream 2 runs a coding agent inside an instance's container, captures its
edits as a patch, and grades that patch by re-applying it and running the
instance's tests. The round-trip is deceptively error-prone: a `git diff` that
looks right can fail to re-apply, or apply the wrong bytes, and the failure is
almost always **silent** — it just grades as unresolved. New files, binaries,
leaked git config, nested `.git` dirs, submodules, and LFS pointers each have a
corner case.

We surveyed how the canonical open-source harnesses (SWE-agent, mini-swe-agent,
OpenHands, Agentless, Moatless, R2E-Gym, and Scale's own SWE-Bench Pro harness)
extract and apply patches, and catalogued ~40 corner cases. That survey is
retained as **non-authoritative background** in
[`docs/patch-extraction.md`](../patch-extraction.md); this ADR is the decision of
record, and the **implementing code is the source of truth**:
[`core/patch.py`](../../src/swe_lab/core/patch.py) (extract/clean),
[`rollout/entryscript.py`](../../src/swe_lab/rollout/entryscript.py) +
[`rollout/runner.py`](../../src/swe_lab/rollout/runner.py) (drive + strip), and
[`core/datasets/swebench_pro/grading.py`](../../src/swe_lab/core/datasets/swebench_pro/grading.py)
(apply + grade).

The decision is scoped to the **MVP happy path**: text patches, one strict
apply, graded exactly like Scale. Several richer behaviors are deliberately
deferred; they are recorded here as backlog so a future instance that needs one
knows the intended shape.

## Decision

The extract → apply → grade contract, in eight facets:

| # | Facet | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Diff base** | Extract diffs the worktree against the instance's original **`base_commit`**. |
| 2 | **Build-noise denylist** | **None.** New files are staged from the repo root with no `:(exclude)` pathspec. |
| 3 | **Binary handling** | **Text-only happy path.** Stage new files with `git add -N`, diff **without** `--binary` (binary bytes are never serialized), then strip any residual `Binary files … differ` marker host-side. |
| 4 | **Diff prefixes / config isolation** | Neutralize all ambient git config (global/system/pager/textconv/EOL); pin `diff.noprefix=false` + `diff.mnemonicPrefix=false` for stable `a/ b/` prefixes on any git version. Do **not** use `--default-prefix` (git ≥ 2.41 only). |
| 5 | **Agent-touched test files** | The grader restores the **golden** test files by path, *after* applying the patch, so an agent cannot game the held-out tests. |
| 6 | **Apply strictness** | A single strict `git apply -v`, matching Scale exactly. No fallback ladder. |
| 7 | **Deferred silent-failure guards** | **Documented, not implemented** (see below). |
| 8 | **Empty patch** | The rollout runner classifies an empty/no-op patch as an explicit `empty_patch` outcome — the eval is skipped, never graded as a pass. |

**Extraction hygiene** (part of facet 3/4): before diffing, stray nested `.git`
directories are removed (a dep the agent cloned, or a fixture that ran
`git init`, would otherwise be staged as one opaque gitlink that swallows its
files and breaks apply). The diff is written as **raw bytes** — no text
round-trip — for transport correctness.

**Facet 7 — deferred guards, documented and intentionally not built.** Three
corner cases can silently mis-extract; we accept the risk for the MVP because
each is a rare edge, and record them so they can be added if one ever bites:

- **Gitignored new source files** — `git add -N` skips a genuinely-new source
  file that happens to match `.gitignore`.
- **Submodules / gitlinks** — a `Subproject commit` line could reach the patch.
- **Git LFS pointer-vs-content** — an `filter=lfs` file could diff as its pointer.

The originally-recorded intent was "defer but log when they would fire"; we have
decided **not to implement even the logging now** — these are very small corner
cases and the detection code is not worth its weight yet. If one is suspected on
a real instance, add detection + a log line at that point.

## Alternatives Considered

### Facet 1 — diff against a post-setup commit instead of `base_commit`
- The "commit-the-base" trick snapshots the container's post-provision state, so
  image-setup mutations can't leak into the patch.
- **Rejected (deferred, P1):** diffing against `base_commit` *guarantees* the
  grading round-trip — the grader does `git reset --hard base_commit` then
  `git apply`, and the dataset's own gold patches are diffs vs `base_commit` and
  apply cleanly, so the convention is proven. The post-setup base is nicer but
  fiddlier; revisit only if setup noise becomes a real problem.

### Facet 2 — a per-ecosystem `:(exclude)` build-noise denylist
- mini-swe-agent excludes `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, lockfiles, etc.
- **Rejected (deferred, P1):** an agent solving a task rarely rewrites build
  config, so there is no material impact today. The `exclude_globs` parameter is
  already wired to add one (with drop-logging, no silent truncation) when needed.

### Facet 3 — faithful binary extract + apply
- Serialize binary hunks (`--binary`) and apply them, for a byte-faithful trace.
- **Rejected (deferred, P1):** Scale strips binary before applying, so emitting
  binary would make our grade *diverge from Scale's* on exactly those patches.
  Text-only keeps us aligned. A faithful two-artifact scheme (clean patch for
  grading + raw for the trace) is a later option.

### Facet 6 — an apply-hardening ladder (`git apply --3way` → `--reject`)
- We hold `base_commit`, so `--3way` is viable and would tolerate more.
- **Rejected (kept optional):** grading strictly like Scale keeps our numbers
  comparable to the leaderboard. Extra tolerance is a clearly-labeled experiment
  behind a flag if we ever want it, never the silent default.

### Facet 8 — an eval-side empty-patch guard
- Have the grader also refuse a directly-supplied empty `--patch-file`.
- **Rejected (deferred, P2):** the rollout side already classifies empties
  explicitly, which covers the real path; a defensive eval-side guard is cheap
  to add later.

## Consequences

- **The round-trip is guaranteed.** A patch relative to `base_commit` applies
  cleanly against the grader's `git reset --hard base_commit`.
- **Patches are text-only.** Binary changes are dropped (the same net effect
  Scale gets by stripping at apply time); the graded patch is always
  cleanly-applyable.
- **Our grade matches Scale's** (single strict apply, no ladder, golden test
  files restored), so results are comparable to the reference and leaderboard.
- **An unresolved run's reason is never guessed** — `empty_patch` vs
  `unresolved_tests_failed` is an explicit outcome.
- **Facet 7's three corners fail silently** if hit — an accepted MVP risk, not an
  oversight. A gold/rollout sweep is the safety net; add detection when one bites.
- **Backlog:** P1 — post-setup base (1), denylist (2), faithful binary (3),
  facet-7 detection (7); P2 — eval-side empty guard (8), fuller test-file reset
  (5). Adding any is an extension, not a rewrite (the seams/parameters exist).
