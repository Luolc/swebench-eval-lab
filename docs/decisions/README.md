# Architecture Decision Records

Sequentially-numbered records of significant, hard-to-reverse decisions and the
alternatives rejected. Format follows the `documentation-and-adrs` skill:
**Status · Date · Context · Decision · Alternatives Considered · Consequences**.

- **Don't re-litigate an accepted ADR.** If a decision must change, write a new
  ADR that references and supersedes the old one; don't edit the old in place or
  delete it (it is the historical record).
- **The code is the source of truth.** An ADR records the *why*; where an ADR and
  the code disagree, the code wins and the ADR should be superseded to match.
