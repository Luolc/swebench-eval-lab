## 1. Purpose & scope

Build the **harness axis's first plug**: `claude_code`. A harness supplies the
run's **main body** (how the agent is invoked in-container) plus the **mounts**
it needs (the pinned binary, the prompt) plus a **trace observer** (stream-json
→ exchange record). It does *not* own the backend, the dataset, or patch
extraction. This task delivers the harness pieces; task 07 assembles them into
`rollout`.

### In scope

- `harnesses/claude_code/`: `ClaudeCodeHarness` (mounts + main body), a
  `StreamTraceObserver`, and its constants.
- Reuse of the existing Claude-Code machinery **by import** (strangler):
  `ensure_claude_binary` (`binary.py`), `parse_stream_events` /
  `build_exchange_from_stream` / `last_stream_record` (`trace.py`).
- The in-container agent invocation ported from `entryscript.py:63-77`, rewired
  to `$SANDBOX_WORKSPACE` paths and run via `sb.exec`.
- Fast, Docker-free tests (fake backend + a scripted trajectory fixture).

### Out of scope

- **Physically moving** `core/agent/` into `harnesses/claude_code/` — deferred
  to cutover so W1 annotation (which imports `core/agent/`) keeps working; see
  §8 Q1. This task's harness *imports* the current modules.
- Patch extraction, the `rollout` composition, and the CLI (task 07).
- The **proxy** capture mode (task 08) — `trace.py`'s proxy branch is untouched;
  this harness uses `capture=stream` only.
- The agent **error taxonomy** (`errors.py`) — it serves W1's retry loop;
  rollout records failure via the exchange's `complete` flag, it does not raise
  and retry (see §5.4).

## 2. Module layout

```
harnesses/
  __init__.py
  claude_code/
    __init__.py
    harness.py     ClaudeCodeHarness (mounts() + build_body()) 
    trace.py       StreamTraceObserver (stateful: exchange + complete)
    constants.py   in-workspace binary/prompt/trajectory/stderr names, HOME, model
```

Tests: `tests/test_claude_code_harness.py` (mounts + body script + trace
observer, all against FakeBackend / fixtures).

## 3. Key types & signatures

```python
# ─── harnesses/claude_code/constants.py ─────────────────────────────────────
BINARY_NAME = "claude"            # copied into the workspace, run from there
PROMPT_NAME = "prompt.txt"
TRAJECTORY_NAME = "trajectory.jsonl"
AGENT_STDERR_NAME = "agent.stderr"
AGENT_HOME_AT = "/tmp/claude-home"   # writable HOME inside the container
DEFAULT_MODEL = "sonnet"
# The token is a rollout-composition concern (task 07 sets the backend's
# pass_env); the agent binary reads $CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN from the env.

# ─── harnesses/claude_code/harness.py ───────────────────────────────────────
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ClaudeCodeHarness:
  """The Claude Code agent as a sandbox-engine harness plug."""

  prompt: str
  model: str = DEFAULT_MODEL
  binary_path: Path | None = None      # default: ensure_claude_binary(...)
  repo_root: Path | None = None

  def mounts(self) -> Mounts:
    """The pinned binary (executable) + the prompt text, staged into the ws."""
    binary = self.binary_path or ensure_claude_binary(repo_root=self.repo_root)
    return {
        BINARY_NAME: Mount(source=binary, executable=True),
        PROMPT_NAME: Mount(content=self.prompt.encode()),
    }

  def build_body(self, workdir: str) -> Callable[[Sandbox], None]:
    """Return the main action: exec the agent invocation in the sandbox."""
    script = self._invocation_script(workdir)
    def body(sb: Sandbox) -> None:
      _ = sb.exec(script, timeout=...)   # timeout threaded by the composition
    return body

  def trace_observer(self) -> StreamTraceObserver: ...

# ─── harnesses/claude_code/trace.py ─────────────────────────────────────────
@dataclass
class StreamTraceObserver(SandboxObserver):
  """Stateful: reads trajectory.jsonl in before_destroy → exchange record."""

  exchange: dict[str, object] = field(default_factory=dict)
  complete: bool = False

  def before_destroy(self, sb: Sandbox) -> Contribution | None:
    self.exchange = last_stream_record(sb.workspace / TRAJECTORY_NAME)
    self.complete = bool(self.exchange.get("complete", False))
    traj = sb.workspace / TRAJECTORY_NAME
    return Contribution(artifacts={"trajectory": traj} if traj.is_file() else {})
```

The timeout is threaded from the composition (task 07) into `build_body`; the
sketch elides it. `build_body` returns a closure so the composition stays
`with manager.sandbox() as sb: body(sb)`.

## 4. The in-container invocation

Ported from `entryscript.py:63-77`, rewired from the old fixed `MOUNT_AT`
constants to `$SANDBOX_WORKSPACE` (the backend's handshake, task 03 §5.5). All
interpolated values `shlex.quote`d (as `entryscript.py:55-61`):

```bash
set -u
export HOME=/tmp/claude-home
mkdir -p "$HOME"
export IS_SANDBOX=1                     # so the agent accepts --dangerously-… as root
cd <workdir>                            # spec.workdir, e.g. /app (no git reset — rollout
                                        #   works from the image's checked-out state)
"$SANDBOX_WORKSPACE"/claude \
  -p "$(cat "$SANDBOX_WORKSPACE"/prompt.txt)" \
  --model <model> --output-format stream-json --verbose \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  > "$SANDBOX_WORKSPACE"/trajectory.jsonl \
  2> "$SANDBOX_WORKSPACE"/agent.stderr || true
```

`|| true` preserves the current swallow (`entryscript.py:51-53,76`): a nonzero
agent exit must still leave the workspace edits for extraction. Model is passed
as an alias straight to `--model` (no alias→id mapping today —
`entryscript.py:73`, `runner.py:73`).

## 5. Design decisions

### 5.1 A harness is a bundle, not a subclass
The engine has no `Harness` base type — a harness is *whatever contributes* a
main body + mounts + a trace observer (spec §The three axes). `ClaudeCodeHarness`
exposes `mounts()`, `build_body()`, `trace_observer()`; the rollout composition
(task 07) wires them into a `SandboxManager`. This keeps the engine
harness-agnostic (it never imports `claude_code`) and lets a second harness
(Codex) register by providing the same three pieces — the CP3 stub proves it.

### 5.2 Reuse `core/agent/` by import; defer the physical move
`ensure_claude_binary`, `parse_stream_events`, `build_exchange_from_stream`,
`last_stream_record` are used as-is (`binary.py:85`, `trace.py:46,100,275`).
W1 annotation still imports `core/agent/` (`pipelines/related_files/
agent_run.py`), so **moving** those files now would break W1 — out of scope
(the spec keeps W1 unmigrated). The Claude-specific code relocates into
`harnesses/claude_code/` at cutover (10b), where W1's import is repointed or a
thin shim is left. This task adds the harness *around* the existing functions.
(§8 Q1 confirms the reuse-not-move call.)

### 5.3 The binary is copied into the workspace, not bind-mounted separately
Old rollout bind-mounted the ~100 MB binary read-only at a fixed path
(`runner.py:135`: `Mount(binary_path, CLAUDE_BIN_AT, read_only=True)`). The
engine's `Mount(source=…)` (task 02) copies it into the per-run workspace, run
from `$SANDBOX_WORKSPACE/claude`. Rationale: it keeps "everything the run needs
is in the one bind-mounted workspace" (a spec principle) and avoids adding a
second-bind-mount concept to the backend. Cost: a ~100 MB `shutil.copyfile` per
run — negligible against a minutes-long agent run, and reclaimed with the
workspace. The binary lives under `/workspace`, not the repo `/app`, so it never
pollutes the extracted diff. *(Alternative — extend the backend with read-only
asset mounts — rejected: more interface for marginal savings; revisit only if
copy cost ever matters.)*

### 5.4 Rollout records failure; it does not classify-and-retry
W1's `errors.py` taxonomy (`classify_error_text`, `UsageLimitError`,
`RetryableError`) drives its retry loop. Rollout's model is different: run the
agent once, `|| true`, capture whatever resulted; a failed/partial run shows up
as `complete == False` (`trace._stream_complete` — `subtype=="success" and not
is_error`, `trace.py:88-97`) and/or an empty patch (task 07). No raising, no
retry here — so this task pulls in none of `errors.py`. (A resample tier, if
ever wanted, is a composition-level concern, not the harness's.)

### 5.5 Stream capture only; proxy is task 08
`StreamTraceObserver` uses `last_stream_record` (the stream branch,
`trace.py:100-105`). `trace.py`'s proxy branch (`last_proxy_record`,
`trace.py:108-125`) is the faithful-wire capture strategy wired in task 08; the
harness will gain a `capture` selector then. Stream needs no proxy process and
is what rollout uses today (`DEFAULT_CAPTURE`, `trace.py:40`).

## 6. Tests (all Docker-free)

- **Mounts:** `mounts()` returns the binary (`source` set, `executable=True`)
  and the prompt (`content` = prompt bytes) at the right target names; the
  binary path defaults through a monkeypatched `ensure_claude_binary`.
- **Invocation script:** the built body script sets `HOME`/`IS_SANDBOX`,
  `cd`s the workdir, invokes `$SANDBOX_WORKSPACE/claude` with `--model`,
  `--output-format stream-json`, `--verbose`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`,
  redirects to `trajectory.jsonl`/`agent.stderr`, ends with `|| true`; values
  are `shlex.quote`d (inject a workdir with a space/quote).
- **Trace observer:** against a checked-in `trajectory.jsonl` fixture (a few
  stream-json lines incl. a terminal `result` with `subtype:"success"`),
  `before_destroy` yields the exchange record, `complete == True`, and
  registers the `trajectory` artifact; a fixture ending in `is_error:true` →
  `complete == False`; an absent file → `{}`, `complete == False`, no artifact.
- **Body runs via exec:** with FakeBackend, `build_body(workdir)(sb)` calls
  `sb.exec` once with the invocation script (assert recorded).

## 7. Dependencies

Tasks 02, 03 (and, at compose time, 04 via task 07). Reuses `core/agent/`
functions — no new runtime deps. New code Google-docstring'd.

## 8. Open questions (need user confirmation)

1. **Reuse-not-move (§5.2)** — OK to have `harnesses/claude_code/` *import*
   `core/agent/{binary,trace}` now and defer the physical relocation +
   W1-import repoint to 10b? (Alternative: move now and repoint W1 in this
   task — bigger blast radius, breaks the strangler's "old path intact".)
2. **Binary copy vs bind-mount (§5.3)** — accept the ~100 MB workspace copy, or
   should I add a read-only asset-mount concept to `DockerHostBackend` now?
   I recommend the copy.
3. **HOME path** — the harness uses its own `/tmp/claude-home`
   (`AGENT_HOME_AT`), independent of rollout's old `/tmp/rollout-home`
   (`rollout/constants.py:20`). Fine, or keep the old name for continuity?
